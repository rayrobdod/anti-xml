Anti-XML: The Non-Violent Solution

** Outdated **

This is a forked version of Anti-XML with improved namespace support.
All credit goes to Daniel Spiewak for a great library, and
Trygve Laugst√∏l for great work for namespace support.

NOTE: the API may still change, but most things should now be backward
compatible from the 0.5 release.

Anti-XML is a proposed replacement for the ``scala.xml`` package in
the Scala standard library. The standard package is outdated and
beyond fixing. We need to start over, on solid foundations and
unburdened by backward compatibility. Anti-XML aims for quality in
three major areas:

* **Usability**

  * Leverage powerful ideas like combinators and proper ADTs_
  * Leverage the 2.8 collections library
  * Provide consistent selector behavior
  * Avoid these missteps: ``Node <: NodeSeq <: Seq[Node]``,
    ``MetaData``, ``Atom[String]``

* **Reliability**

  * Use immutable data structures (in the API and under the hood too)
  * Avoid bugs and race conditions
  * Provide a proper ``equals``
  
* **Performance**

  * Lower memory usage (`Novell Vibe`_ once had a 16 MB chunk of XML
    use 250 MB of heap!)
  * Provide efficient selectors

We are exploring `many ideas`_ for this project. It will be
interesting to see where things go!

Usage
=====

The Maven artifact descriptor for the latest *stable* version of
Anti-XML is as follows: ``no.arktekk:anti-xml_2.9.1:0.5.1``.  We also regularly
push ``-SNAPSHOT`` releases to the Sonatype_ "snapshots" repository, for all
five of you who like to live dangerously.  You should be able to use this
descriptor to easily add Anti-XML as a dependency to any project with a
Maven-compatible build system (Maven, Buildr, SBT, Gradle, Ivy, etc). The stable
artifacts themselves are hosted in the Maven Central repository.  For
reference, here are a few copy/paste snippets you can use for some of the common
build systems.

**SBT**

.. code-block:: scala
  
    val antiXML = "no.arktekk" %% "anti-xml" % "0.5.1"
  
**Buildr**

.. code-block:: ruby
  
    compile.with "no.arktekk:anti-xml_#{Scala.version}:jar:0.5.1"
  
**Maven2**

.. code-block:: xml
  
    <dependency>
      <groupId>no.arktekk</groupId>
      <artifactId>anti-xml_2.9.1</artifactId>
      <version>0.5.1</version>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>no.arktekk</groupId>
      <artifactId>anti-xml_2.9.2</artifactId>
      <version>0.5.1</version>
    </dependency>

Contributing
============

Contributions are most welcome!  Fork, hack, request pull, rinse and repeat.  If
you're looking for things to work on, I would check the `issue tracker`_ or the
`official TODO list`_.  However, before you get started, be sure to read the
information in CONTRIBUTING.rst_.  It offers some basic code guidelines (don't
worry, curly braces aren't a religious issue here) and explains the legal
mumbo-jumbo involved in contributing.
